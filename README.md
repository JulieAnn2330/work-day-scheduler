Work Day Scheduler

Deployed program: https://julieann2330.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

Technologies Used: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, moment.js, jQuery

This is a homework assignment that I created for the University of Kansas Coding BootCamp. 

This week we are building an online planning calendar. The calendar was supposed to show the hours from 9am to 5pm. I extended this from 8am - 8pm for further flexibility. The calendar is intuitive, click in the box and add your text, the save button will save the text, even upon refresh or closing the browser and coming back. The delete button will delete the item from the calendar completely. This last button I added for convenience. The blocks of time will recognize if they are in the past, present or future and are color coded thusly. 

I utilized several coding websites for help, including StackOverflow and w3schools.com I also watched YouTube tutorials and got assistance from fellow student Aurora Brune.

The full details of the project are listed below.


# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
